    <h3>Ancient</h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 10px;">Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes,
        who at times travelled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, l
        earn new languages, experience new cultures, enjoy pristine nature and to taste different cuisines. A
        s early as Shulgi, however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for
        travellers.[37] Travelling for pleasure can be seen in Egypt as early on as 1500 BC.[38] Ancient R
        oman tourists during the Republic would visit spas and coastal resorts such as Baiae. They were popular among
        the rich.
        The Roman upper class used to spend their free time on land or at sea and travelled to their villa urbana or
        villa maritima.
        Numerous villas were located in Campania, around Rome and in the northern part of the Adriatic as in Barcola
        near Trieste
        . Pausanias wrote his Descriptio
        n of Greece in the second century AD. In ancient
        China, nobles sometimes made a point of visiting Mount Tai and, on occasion, all five Sacred Mountains.</p>


    <h3>Significance of tourism</h3>

    <p>The tourism industry, as part of the service sector,[52] has become an important source of income for many
        regions and even for
        entire countries. The Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as "an activity
        essential to the life
        of nations because of its direct
        effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their
        international
        relations."[3][53]</p>
