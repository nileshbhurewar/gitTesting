            <h2>Historical Tourism</h2>
            <p>
                Numerous villas were located in Campania, around Rome and in the northern part of the Adriatic as in Barcola
                near Trieste. Pausanias wrote his <em>Description of Greece</em> in the second century AD. In ancient
                China, nobles sometimes made a point of visiting Mount Tai and, on occasion, all five Sacred Mountains.

            <h3>Significance of Tourism</h3>
            <p>
                The tourism industry, as part of the service sector, has become an important source of income for many
                regions and even for entire countries. The Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as "an activity
                essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their international relations."
